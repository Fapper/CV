    I was born and raised in Denmark until I was 5 years of age,
    whereafter we moved for a total of 9 years abroad, 4 of which
    were spent in England, and 5 in the US. That means that I'm quite
    used to speaking Danish and English with locals and can adapt to
    new cultural environments. Currently I live by myself and in the
    future, I see myself working in the tech, medicinal, or automotive
    industries.

    Currently I'm taking the first year of my masters degree abroad at
    the University of California, San Diego from Aalborg University
    here in Denmark. I attend 7th semester and engage in interesting
    problem-based project group work along with following courses.
    As an example, we as a 6-man group designed and implemented a
    programming language from the bottom up to make it easier for
    non-programmers to design board games. 

    \section{\mysidestyle Education}
    I have quite a normal educational background, except for the
    physical locations! Educational-wise, I plan to take the first year of
    my 2-year master's in the US and then finish it at Aalborg University.

    (2011 - 2014) Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (180 ECTS
    credits). I graduated with an average of B on the European ECTS
    scale.

    Hjørring, Denmark. I took the highest level Math, Physics, English,
    Electronics, and Danish possible.

\section{\mysidestyle Interests}
When I'm not in front of my computer, I love to enjoy a cup of tea and read non-fiction. There is also nothing better than travelling the world, so I try to do that as much as possible, and thankfully due to my fantastic friends, I've had quite a few fantastic experiences travelling to visit then. I also enjoy electronic and classical music, such as house and Tchaikovsky. Keeping my body healthy and in shape is also important to me, so naturally I quite enjoy cooking sexy, irresistable food!

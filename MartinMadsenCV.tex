    \vspace{1cm}

    I was born and raised in Denmark until I was $5$ years of age,
    whereafter we moved for a total of $9$ years abroad, $4$ of which
    were spent in England, and $5$ in the US. That means that I'm quite
    used to speaking Danish and English with locals and can adapt to
    new cultural environments. Currently I live by myself and in the
    future, I see myself working in the tech, medicinal, or automotive
    industries.

    Currently I study Computer Science at Aalborg University here
    in Denmark. I attend 6th semester and engage in interesting
    problem-based project group work along with following courses.
    As an example, we as a 6 person group designed and implemented a
    programming language from the bottom up to make it easier for
    non-programmers to design board games. This semester is focused on
    machine intelligence, which piques my interest.

    \section{\mysidestyle Education}
    I have quite a normal educational background, except for the
    physical locations! Educational-wise, I plan to take the first year of
    my $2$-year master's in the US and then finish it at Aalborg University.

    \textbf{Aalborg University - Bachelor of Science, Computer Sience}
    ($2011$ - $2014$) I finish $6$th semester June $2014$ and will then
    have my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My master's degree
    will be completed during the summer of $2016$.
      
    \textbf{EUC Nord - HTX} ($2008$ - $2011$) Technical gymnasium in
    Hjørring, Denmark. I took the highest level Math, Physics, English,
    and Danish possible.
    
    \textbf{Bagterpskolen} ($2006$ - $2008$) Completed the Danish
    Folkeskole Education in Hjørring, Denmark.

    \textbf{J. R. Gerrits Middle School} ($2003$ - $2006$) Elementary and 
    Middle School i Kimberly, Wisconsin, USA.

\section{\mysidestyle Interests}
When I'm not in front of my computer, I love to enjoy a cup of tea and read non-fiction. There is also nothing better than travelling the world, so I try to do that as much as possible, and thankfully due to my fantastic friends, I've had quite a few fantastic experiences travelling to visit then. I also enjoy electronic and classical music, such as house and Tchaikovsky. Keeping my body healthy and in shape is also important to me, so naturally I quite enjoy cooking sexy, irresistable food!

    Hello there! My name's Martin and I was born and raised in Denmark
    until I was 5 years of age, whereafter my family moved for a total
    of 9 years abroad, 4 of which were spent in England, and 5 in the
    US. That means that I've learned English and Danish speaking with
    locals, and I can quickly adapt to new cultural environments.

    Currently I'm taking the first year of my masters degree in
    Computer Science from Aalborg University abroad at the University
    of California, San Diego. I sincerely hope my CV impresses you.
    
    I've had a Danish driver's license for 4 years.

\section{\mysidestyle Interests}
When I'm not in front of my computer, I love to enjoy a cup of tea and read non-fiction. There is also nothing better than travelling the world, so I try to do that as much as possible, and thankfully due to my fantastic friends, I've had quite a few amazing experiences travelling to visit then. I also enjoy electronic and classical music. Keeping my body healthy and in shape is also important to me, as I believe it keeps my mind fit too. Thankfully, I quite enjoy cooking, and working out, and recently I have started getting into biking thanks to my dad's interest (he biked from Denmark to Paris, France!), transitioning from jogging regularly.
